# React Pokedex
In this app, I practiced creating React components and passing/accessing props by creating two "Pokedexes". Each one is generated randomly from a set of Pokemon, and each Pokemon has base experience points. The "Pokedex" with the higher total experience "wins." Refresh the page to generate a new set of Pokedexes.
